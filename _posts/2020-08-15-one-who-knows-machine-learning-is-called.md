The short answer: _**A Machine Learning Engineer**_

Brief explanation:

* 🗡️ First, we have a **Software Engineer**: one who writes code to solve problems.
* 🗡️ Also, we have a **Data Scientist**: one who collects, analyzes, and interprets extremely large amount of data.
* ⚔️ And now, we have a **Machine Learning Engineer**: one who does the both roles above. They write code that analyzes a large dataset to solve a specific problem.
