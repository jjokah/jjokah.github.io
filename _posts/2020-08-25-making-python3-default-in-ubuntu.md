I came into the python world at 2017, and ever since then, I have never thought of using _Python2_. Now in 2020, I just updated my OS to Ubuntu 20.04 and I have no idea what _python2_ is doing on my terminal, talkless of even being the default.

But this is how I made _python3_ my default:

ðŸ“Œ First I typed **gedit ~/.bashrc** on my terminal to open the .bashrc file on my text editor.
```shell
$ gedit ~/.bashrc
```
ðŸ“Œ And then I added 
**alias python=python3**
to the top of the .bashrc file and saved it.

That was it. ðŸš€ðŸš€

What this means is that whenever I write _python_ on my terminal, it sees it as _python3_
