Why should you be stuck at using only your system's default font? That's not fair to the other thousands of pretty fonts out there. Well, in the next minute, I will show you how to start using other fonts in any desktop application.

## Here are 3 easy steps:

- 🔍 First, check the web for any downloadable font ([Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)) and then download it to your computer.
- 📦 If it's a zip folder, extract it and look for the .ttf or .otf file and open it.
- 🖱️ When you open the file, click install to add the font to your system.

AND we are Done.

Not so fast. I'm still here.
I know I was supposed to tell you how to add it to your application (like photoshop, ms word, LibreOffice, and whatever...)
Yea, but there's no need for that because all these apps directly check out the fonts installed on your system. So your newly installed font should be ready for use, the next time you open up your app.

If for any reason, you want to manually add the font to your system _(maybe the files to click and install are many or your system is having a bad day)_,
You can simply drag and drop the extracted files into your system's Fonts Directory.

**for windows**: drag and drop it here,
_Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization > Fonts_

**for linux**: drag and drop it here,
_/usr/local/share/fonts/_
(Note: use *__sudo nautilus__* to open a root file browser)

_Finally, drag your mouse/finger to the like button and click on it._

THAT'S ALL FOR NOW. 👋
Go lighten up your words with some preTTy FoNtS.
